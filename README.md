A little python to help figure out who might be fun to work with :)

Takes your name and lets you cross reference against others using overlaid radar charts

## Install

Inside your directory create a virtual environment and run:

pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib

add a folder titled 'data' in the root directory

download the csv file from google sheets and put it in the data folder



## Run

Activate your virtual environment

Run the jupyter file and in the last line replace 'Your_name' with your name as it appeared in the google form. 

you'll then be prompted with who you would like to compare your preferences with and you can just input the number that corresponds to that name
